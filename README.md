jTable is a jQuery plugin used to create AJAX based CRUD tables without coding HTML or Javascript. It has several features including:

* Automatically creates HTML table and loads records from server using AJAX.
* 'Create new record' html5 dialog form. When user creates a record, it sends data to the server using AJAX and adds the same record to the table in the page.
* 'Edit record' html5 dialog form. When user edits a record, it updates the server using AJAX and updates all cells on the table in the page.
* Allow user to 'delete a record' by html5 dialog based confirmation. When user deletes a record, it deletes the record from server using AJAX and deletes the record from the table in the page.
* Shows simple animations (delay) for create/delete/edit operations on the table.
* Supports server side paging and sorting using AJAX.
* Supports master/child tables.
* Allows user to select rows.
* Allows user to resize and show/hide columns.
* Exposes some events to enable validation with forms.
* Can be localized easily.
* All styling of table and forms is defined in a CSS file, so you can easily change the style of everything to use the plugin in your pages. The CSS file is well defined and commented.
* Comes with several pre-defined color themes.
* Not dependent on any server side technology.
* OS independent and works on all common browsers.
